## 📦 Requirements

Install the following Python packages before running the project. You can install them manually or via the `requirements.txt`.

### 🛠 Installation (Recommended)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔧 requirements.txt

Create a file named `requirements.txt` and add the following packages:

```txt
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyterlab       # Optional: If using Jupyter Notebooks
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CreditFraud.git
cd CreditFraud
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the script

```bash
python creditcard.py
```

Make sure your data file is correctly placed and formatted.

## 🧠 Model

- Uses a machine learning algorithm such as Logistic Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost (based on your actual implementation).
- Trained on anonymized credit card transaction data.
- Performs binary classification: **Fraud** vs **Not Fraud**

---

## ❗ Common Errors

- **`ValueError: could not convert string to float:`**  
  Ensure your data fields are properly aligned and sliced before parsing.

- **Missing packages**  
  Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.

---

## 📊 Future Work

- Improve data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Try deep learning models or ensemble methods.
- Deploy using Flask/FastAPI or streamlit.
